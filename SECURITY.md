## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email** security issues to: walsh2232@users.noreply.github.com
3. **Include** as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target**: 30 days for critical issues, 90 days for others

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and verify the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisory (if desired)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with secure token storage
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2 integration with Oracle Cloud
- Session management with secure cookies
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection with Content Security Policy

### Infrastructure Security

- Docker container security best practices
- Environment variable management
- Secure defaults for all configurations
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning

### Development Security

- Secure coding practices
- Static application security testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Pre-commit hooks for security checks
- Code review requirements

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

We use the following tools for automated security testing:

- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Additional dependency scanning
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis

### Manual Security Testing

- Regular penetration testing
- Security code reviews
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation testing
- Session management testing

## üìã Security Checklist

### For Developers

- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- [ ] Validate all inputs on both client and server
- [ ] Use parameterized queries for database operations
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Follow secure coding practices
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all communications
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Use strong authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Apply principle of least privilege

### For Deployment

- [ ] Use secure container images
- [ ] Configure firewalls and network security
- [ ] Enable logging and monitoring
- [ ] Use secrets management systems
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery plans
- [ ] Security headers configuration
- [ ] Rate limiting and DDoS protection

## üîß Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Strong secret key (generate with: openssl rand -hex 32)
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-minimum-32-characters

# Database encryption key
DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-database-encryption-key

# OAuth2 configuration
OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your-oauth2-client-id
OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=your-oauth2-client-secret

# TLS/SSL configuration
TLS_CERT_PATH=/path/to/certificate.pem
TLS_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private-key.pem
```

### Security Headers

We implement the following security headers:

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## üìä Vulnerability Management

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate risk, patch within 24 hours
- **High**: Significant risk, patch within 7 days
- **Medium**: Moderate risk, patch within 30 days
- **Low**: Minor risk, patch in next release cycle

### Response Process

1. **Triage**: Assess severity and impact
2. **Develop**: Create and test security fix
3. **Test**: Verify fix resolves issue without breaking functionality
4. **Deploy**: Release security update
5. **Communicate**: Notify users of security update
6. **Monitor**: Monitor for any issues post-deployment

## üöÄ Security Updates

### How to Stay Informed

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Follow our repository for security advisories
- **Release Notes**: Check release notes for security updates
- **Email Notifications**: Subscribe to security update notifications
