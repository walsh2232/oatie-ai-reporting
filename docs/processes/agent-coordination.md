# GitHub Copilot Agent Coordination Protocols

## Overview

This document establishes protocols and guidelines for coordinating work between human developers and GitHub Copilot agents within the Oatie project ecosystem.

## Agent Coordination Principles

### 1. Clear Communication
- All agent interactions must be traceable and auditable
- Agents should provide clear rationale for their suggestions and changes
- Human oversight is required for all agent-generated code

### 2. Quality Standards
- Agents must adhere to the same code quality standards as human developers
- All agent contributions must pass automated quality checks
- Agent-generated code requires human review before merging

### 3. Transparency
- Mark agent-generated contributions clearly in commit messages and PRs
- Document agent reasoning and decision-making process
- Maintain visibility into agent activities and contributions

## Agent Classification

### Agent Types

#### 1. Code Generation Agents
- **Purpose**: Generate new code based on specifications
- **Scope**: Feature implementation, boilerplate generation, test creation
- **Oversight**: High - requires detailed review

#### 2. Code Review Agents
- **Purpose**: Analyze code for quality, security, and best practices
- **Scope**: Automated code review, suggestion generation
- **Oversight**: Medium - suggestions reviewed by humans

#### 3. Documentation Agents
- **Purpose**: Generate and maintain documentation
- **Scope**: API docs, README updates, code comments
- **Oversight**: Medium - content accuracy verification required

#### 4. Testing Agents
- **Purpose**: Generate and maintain test suites
- **Scope**: Unit tests, integration tests, test data generation
- **Oversight**: High - test logic must be verified

#### 5. Maintenance Agents
- **Purpose**: Perform routine maintenance tasks
- **Scope**: Dependency updates, code formatting, refactoring
- **Oversight**: Low - routine tasks with automated verification

## Workflow Protocols

### 1. Agent Task Assignment

#### Human-Initiated Tasks
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Human Creates Issue] --> B[Issue Analysis]
    B --> C{Agent Suitable?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Assign to Agent]
    C -->|No| E[Human Assignment]
    D --> F[Agent Work]
    F --> G[Human Review]
    G --> H{Approved?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Merge]
    H -->|No| J[Iterate]
    J --> F
```

#### Agent-Initiated Tasks
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent Identifies Issue] --> B[Create Issue]
    B --> C[Human Triage]
    C --> D{Approve Agent Work?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Agent Implementation]
    D -->|No| F[Human Assignment]
    E --> G[Human Review]
    G --> H[Merge/Iterate]
```

### 2. Agent Work Submission

#### Required Information
- **Agent Identity**: Which agent performed the work
- **Task Description**: What the agent was asked to do
- **Reasoning**: Why the agent chose this approach
- **Validation**: How the agent verified the solution
- **Testing**: What testing was performed

#### Commit Message Format
```

  - Support for multiple report formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)
  - Asynchronous processing for large reports
  - Authentication required
  - Rate limiting implemented

Constraints:
  - Use existing authentication middleware
  - Follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification
  - Maximum response time: 30 seconds
  - Support for up to 10,000 records

Acceptance Criteria:
  - API documented in OpenAPI spec
  - Unit tests with >95% coverage
  - Integration tests included
  - Error handling for all edge cases
  - Performance tests passing

References:
  - Similar endpoint: /api/v1/exports
  - Authentication docs: docs/auth.md
  - Performance requirements: docs/performance.md
```

### 2. Communication Protocols

#### Agent Status Updates
- Agents should provide regular status updates
- Include progress metrics and blockers
- Report any changes to original plan
- Highlight areas needing human input

#### Human Feedback Format
```markdown
## Review Feedback for Agent Work

### Approved Changes
- Authentication implementation looks good
- Test coverage meets requirements
